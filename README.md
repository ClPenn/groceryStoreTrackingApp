Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

Grocery Store Tracking Application that takes in the stores daily bought inventory, sorts and attaches a value to each item.  This is done by taking a .txt file containing the item name each time it is purchased.  Python functions sort through the list and assign a value to each item, according to how many times that item appears on the list. Other Python functions in the Tracking app search for how many times a particular item appears and a histogram function that prints a histogram from .dat file.   C++ is used as the infrastructure for the app, Displaying a user menu with to each python function.  

    What did you do particularly well? 

Overall I think what I did well was develop an easy functional menu for users to view and use. 	 

    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

I do still have a bug in the app.  The main{} uses a while loop and it enters an infinite loop when any ‘character’ is entered oustide the switch statement.   So, that Is a definite  area of my code that will improve the overall functionality of my app. 

    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

The most challenging part of this program to figure out was writing the python functions.  And I mean finding the correct way to run and call the functions so I dd not run out of memory on the C++ side. 

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

During the project I spent much more time reading code than I usually would have.  And it has made me much more comfortable writing and implementing what I’m trying to accomplish.  Going forward I’m going to make a point to read more of the languages that I know and look up different projects to see how others implement code in their own way. 

    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

I found out early on while writing code that keeping your code organized and clean makes it much easier to go back to a section and understand my own logic.  For that reason I think this project is easily maintainable and readable.  The C++ function calls along with python functions makes it easy to add and remove a particular feature.
